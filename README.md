# FHNW-IT-Notes

Collection of notes for different modules.  
Add notes as you go, the idea is to share knowedge and reduce stress.

Create a new branch out of develop
(git checkout develop, then git checkout -b feature/my-super-cute-branch)
and add your notes to it, create a pr to merge it into develop

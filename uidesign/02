The design of everyday things (book)

How make things useful

Physical design being the base

Norman door

You can purposely design something that is shit or just build sth without thought, that is good

3 Fields

Industrial design
    focus on function and appearance of product, often Physical

Interaction design
    focus on how interact and use it

Experience design
    focus  on quality and enjoyment of it


Human centered design
    Design a design in a way, so that humand dont have to adapt



Conceptual models
    explanation of how something works
    not necessarily accurate or complete
    can differ from person to person

Designer's conceptual model
    idea how it works under the hood

user's conceptual model
    basic, very inaccurate, unga bunga mode... but we have to design for those
    only knows black box
system image
    information aviable to the user
    looks
    instructions
    infos from sales person
    website
    articles

well designed does not need to read instructions, it shoudl be clea

BREAK rules!

good design allows tbe user to discover how a system should work. a good conceptual model is key
(Discoverability in a system design)

Concepts:
    Affordances
        relationship between obj and person
        how it could be used
            like touching it, throwing it away, licking it, what ever
        depends on obj and person
        perceivable to effective
        needs to be perceivable -> hidden door, apple mouse
    Signifiers
        apple mouse logo, make it at least usable
        visible, audible, tactical
        perceivable -> help Affordances
        shows, where / how to interact
        lables, icons
        can be unintentional -> foodprints on snow, fingerprints on tocuh screen
        important for Discoverability
        not important for purpos of being abele to use the objec
        can make a product worse if done poorly
        can be integrated with affordances -> door handle -> good design includes all the needed Signifiers into affordances -> bars on door, instead of pull-bar on push side
        doesn't change what you can do with a systema
        affordances wins over Signifiers -> throwing rubish in a trashcan marked with a lable dont throw trash in it
    Constraints
        limits
        clues for the correct things to do
        like grayed out buttons
        useful for helping people determine proper course of action in a new situation
        absence of feature != constrain
        hardware limitations != constrain
        Phisical
            can't
            you can't put an elephant into a recycling container
            USB-A plug
            prevent an action before it happebs, rather than when it's in progress
            better make things not orientation sensitive -> usb-c
            you can't delete a file as normal user
                read a message, grayed out buttons, effective
            force the desired behavior by disrupting
                slow down users, bring conscious attention
                    Interlock -> particular sequence (need to shift in neutral to start car or setup wizards)
                    Lock Ins -> force user to not stop a task prematurely (atm keeps back the money, till you get your card out or confirm that you want to leave the page)
                    Lock Outs -> prevent someone from killing / harming themselfs (gate keeping you out of the lion cage or warning to not enter a phishing website)
        Cultural
            should
            you should not put a granate into a recycling container
            changes over time
            not universally
            for example shower handle -> blue = cold, red = hot
            60kmh sign
            funny buttons on app / style
        Simantic
            meaning of the situation
            should
            common sense
            drag a file to a printer, rather than trashcan icon
        Logical
            should
            if there is one puzzle pice isn't there, the last one will go there
    Mapping
        relationship between two sets of elements -> controll -> button to light bulb
        natural mappings -> takes advantage of spatial relationships -> good for Discoverability
            touch screen
            mouse
            toch pads
            joysticks
        Stove controll being shit -> no good mapping
    Feedback
        Communication of the outcome of the action
        Touch, hearing, taste, small, visual, auditory
        Little feedback feels strange
        No feedback makes tasks almost inpossible
        must be immediate
        must be informtive
        must be unobtrustive

        Physical keyboards are a lot better
        Progressbars are nice
